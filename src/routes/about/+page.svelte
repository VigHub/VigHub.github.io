		<h2>C to C: from Curiosity to Code</h2>
		<p>
			Ever since I was a child, I was captivated by the incredible ads I saw on TVâ€”like a road
			suddenly turning vertical or a house transforming into a spaceship. These amazing visuals
			sparked my curiosity, and I always wanted to understand the magic behind them. My fascination
			with math naturally led me to pursue a path in Computer Engineering.
		</p>
		<p>
			Today, that childhood curiosity has evolved into a passion for software development and
			machine learning. I thrive on solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions. From
			developing intelligent algorithms to building robust applications, I am driven by the same
			wonder and excitement I felt as a kid, now with the skills and knowledge to bring those
			amazing ideas to life.
